# A-A-B-Test-Project-for-a-Food-Selling-Start-Up

- It is an integrated project I did during my DA studies at Practicum100.
- The project deals with investigating user behavior for the food selling start-up's app. 
- The goal is to reveal which set of fonts used in the app's design produces better sales results.
- The project includes studying the sales funnels, finding out how users reach the purchase stage, an A/A/B test and sudying its results.
